## Project Description
### Background
Homelessness has been a serious growing problem in the United States due to a growing shortage of affordable rental housing and increase in the cost of living. According to a report released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Washington State experienced a 6.2% increase in homelessness between 2019-2020, during which time 30 out of every 10,000 people in the state were homeless. The 2020 Point-in-Time count for Seattle/King County found 11,751 people experiencing homelessness on one night in January, with 53% sheltered and 47% unsheltered. It is important to care about the unsheltered homeless as it could often lead to isolation, a higher risk of mental illness, and physical vulnerability such as hate crime and disease. 
### Problem Statement
How might Individuals in need of shelter gain better access to shelter information so that they can make better-informed decisions about the condition and risk before arriving?


### Propsed solution
We aim to create platform that provides information on shelter to help individuals to find shelters that meets their need and concern. From our research, we learned that one bad experience or rumors on shelters make people hesitant to visit shelter for both new and experienced homeless. Therefore, creating an environment where everyone is welcomed to freely talk about their experience on shelters could reduce oneâ€™s concern/ fear on making visits on shelters

### Technical Description
#### Potential Architecture (might change in the future)

### Current progress
At this point we have finished several pages and the basic workflow for both regular and shelter staff user. User is able to walk thourouth the authentication process, seeing the list of shelters, checking shelter details and post shelter review. However most of the feature aren't working yet just so we can spend more time focus on making our MVP looks complete. We have create mock data for shelter information and reivew, so it looks more realistic. 

Our next stage of development will primary focus on backend integration, refinding stylistic features, and adding new features to address usability and ethical issues. 


### `yern start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Data Models
Coming soon...
**new design due to recently introduced new feature**

#### Team Collaboation Rules
- create code review before pushing the code 
- work on local/seperate branch and later merge to main once code review is approved
- write clear comments on each commit to track workflow easier
